#Video 2: API to HTML
This video takes you from API data to simple HTML, using jQuery to load data and build HTML dynamically. 

##Before you start you will need:

- Access to the DarkSky API (see the previous video)
- Familiarity with basic HTML, Javascript and jQuery
- A good text editor (I like Brackets, Sublime Text also works well)
- A browser for local file testing (I use Safari, Firefox also works, Chrome not so much)
