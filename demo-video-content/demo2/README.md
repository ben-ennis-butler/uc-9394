# Video 2: Adding a forecast table; simple CSS
This video builds on the previous demo, building a table for the DarkSky data. 

## Before you start you will need:

- Access to the DarkSky API (see the previous video)
- Familiarity with basic HTML, Javascript and jQuery
- A good text editor (I like Brackets, Sublime Text also works well)
- A browser for local file testing (I use Safari, Firefox also works, Chrome not so much)
