# Video 4: GeoLocation
This video builds on the previous examples and adds the ability to change the data retrieved by location 


## Key points include:

- Sensing geolocation through the browser
- updating the API call

## Other 
- If you want to get the location name (after getting the location via the browser's geolocation service), then you need to retrieve it by reverse geocoding. This means using another service (api) to send a query with the lat long data and then seeing what it returns. Common geocoding api's include (both require a free api key):
-- [Open Cage Geocoder API](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api)
-- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse)
